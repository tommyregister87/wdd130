        <h3>Site Purpose & Goals:</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of this site is to open up an online store for my grandfather art to be sold. <br> There will be catagories depending on the scenery type. With this, I will discuss his <br> experience, display his work, and eventually help post tutorial videos of how to create <br> the pictures yourself. Overall, this site will be used as a cost effective way for consumers <br> to not only purchase fine art themselves, but to also grow their own skill sets.  
        </p>
        <p>Some of the things needed for the site are About Me, Gallary, and Contacts pages. <br> Moreover, the Gallary will have prices attached to each individual picture. <br> One things that I would like to attempt on the home page is a horizontal picture <br> scroll to keep the page simplistic. I am going to attempt the "less is more" approch <br>to this website by utilizing lines rather than boxes.
