        <h3>Site Purpose & Goals:</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of this site is to open up an online store for my grandfather art to be sold. </br> There will be catagories depending on the scenery type. With this, I will discuss his </br> experience, display his work, and eventually help post tutorial videos of how to create </br> the pictures yourself. Overall, this site will be used as a cost effective way for consumers </br> to not only purchase fine art themselves, but to also grow their own skillsets.  
        </p>

        <p>Some of the things needed for the site are About Me, Gallary, and Contacts pages. </br> Moreover, the Gallary will have prices attacked to each individual picture. </br> One things that I would like to attempt on the home page is a horizontal picture </br> scroll to keep the page simplistic. I am going to attempt the "less is more" approch </br>to this website by utilizing lines rather than boxes.
