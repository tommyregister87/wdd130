        <h3>Site Purpose & Goals:</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of this site is to open up an online store for my grandfather art to me sold. There will be catagories depending on the scenery type. With this, I will discuss his experience, display his work, and eventually help post tutorial videos of how to create the pictures yourself.
