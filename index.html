    <h1>Thomas Register</h1>
    Hi, my name is Thomas Register. I live in the Salt Lake area but have lived in California, Idaho, and Washington. I have been married for seven years to my wonderful wife, Toni. In addition, we have two children. Our first born, Ren, was born still on 04/05/19. Our second born, Delta, was born on 11/12/2020. Professionally, I have been a firefighter for 10 years. Though I have a minor in Communications, I am now enrolled at Brigham Young University-Idaho persuing a major in Applied Technology. Though it may be hard to convey though text, my life has been nothing short of <strong>EVENTFUL!</strong> Hopefully you will gain a little insight below.
    <em>Enjoy!</em>
